 linux command to check opearing system details
1. uname -a
2. cat /etc/os-release


Linux SandboxHost-638649245973367321 5.10.102.2-microsoft-standard #1 SMP Mon Mar 7 17:36:34 UTC 2022 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

This output is from the uname -a command and provides several details about your Linux system. Here’s a breakdown of each part:

    Linux: This indicates the kernel name.

    SandboxHost-638649245973367321: This is the hostname of the system. It typically identifies the machine on the network.

    5.10.102.2-microsoft-standard: This is the kernel version. The version number indicates the specific release of the Linux kernel you are running. The "microsoft-standard" part suggests that this kernel is a version tailored for running on Windows, likely under WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

    #1 SMP Mon Mar 7 17:36:34 UTC 2022: This part includes several pieces of information:
        #1: This indicates the build number of the kernel.
        SMP: Stands for Symmetric Multi-Processing, indicating that the kernel supports multiple processors.
        Mon Mar 7 17:36:34 UTC 2022: This is the date and time when the kernel was built.

    x86_64 x86_64 x86_64: This indicates the architecture of the machine. It shows that you are running a 64-bit version of Linux on an x86 architecture.

    GNU/Linux: This indicates that the system uses the GNU operating system tools alongside the Linux kernel.

Overall, this output tells you that you're running a 64-bit Linux system, specifically a Microsoft-optimized kernel, likely in a virtualized environment like WSL.

*****************************
As a DevOps engineer, understanding the configurations of a virtual machine (VM) is essential for effective management, deployment, and automation. Here are key configurations you should be familiar with:
1. CPU Configuration

    Number of CPUs: Understand how many virtual CPUs (vCPUs) are allocated.
    CPU Shares and Limits: Know how to manage CPU resource allocation among VMs.

2. Memory Configuration

    RAM Size: Be aware of how much memory is allocated to the VM.
    Memory Reservations and Limits: Understand how to set reservations for guaranteed memory and limits for maximum usage.

3. Storage Configuration

    Disk Size and Type: Know the allocated disk size and whether it’s SSD, HDD, etc.
    Disk Provisioning Type: Understand thick vs. thin provisioning.
    Data Persistence: Know how data is stored and backed up.

4. Networking Configuration

    Network Interfaces: Understand how many NICs are configured and their types (bridged, NAT, host-only).
    IP Addressing: Know whether the VM uses static or dynamic IP addressing (DHCP).
    Firewall Rules and Security Groups: Familiarize yourself with network security settings.

5. Operating System Configuration

    OS Type and Version: Be aware of the OS installed and its version.
    Kernel Version: Know the kernel version, especially for Linux VMs.

6. Virtualization Platform

    Hypervisor Type: Understand the hypervisor being used (e.g., VMware, Hyper-V, KVM, etc.).
    Management Tools: Familiarity with tools like vSphere, OpenStack, or Azure.

7. Automation and Configuration Management

    Provisioning Tools: Know tools like Terraform, Ansible, or Puppet for automating VM provisioning.
    Configuration Files: Understand how to manage and modify configuration files for automation.

8. Monitoring and Logging
